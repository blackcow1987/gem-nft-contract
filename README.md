### Description

The project is an NFT collection and marketplace featuring Gems, which rewards users with monetary value through staking TON. Users interact with a game-like interface to mint new Gems, as well as to buy, sell, and burn them. Additionally, users can forge two Gems to obtain a rarer Gem. Users can deposit TON on Layer 1 (L1) and receive a wrapped version called sTON. After bridging these tokens to Layer 2 (L2), users utilize L2 WSTON at a discount price.

When a user wishes to acquire a new Gem from the pre-minted pool, the token is assigned randomly using the VDF verifier implementation.
